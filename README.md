Jupyter notebooks are a great environment for interactively working with code.

## Installing Jupyter Notebook 
The easiest way to get started with Jupyter Notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads). Anaconda is a popular Python distribution which comes pre-equipped with several useful packages (e.g.,  NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib), and makes installing new packages very simple (more on this later). In order to install Anaconda, you should:

1. [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) the latest version of Anaconda (i.e., Python 3.8). The installer you download will depend on the specifications of the machine you are using.
2. Open the .exe file you just downloaded, and follow the instructions.
3. To make sure the download went smoothly, open your command line and enter.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
If this opens a new tab in your default web browser with the Jupyter logo in the top-left, the installation was successful and you should be good to go!
